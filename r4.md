#### Visualisation to Model:
The visualisation for this GOMS analysis is the same CNN representation, as from week 3:

http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/

The stated purpose of the visualisation is to provide a node-link viz on the internal behaviour of a standard convolutional neural network, in the presence of and reaction to a single test example for classification- and not just its static structure. The project’s motivation to extend and improve upon prior representations of shallow and convolutional nets also implies a certain expectation of understanding and experience in the user- if you’re unfamiliar with the general syntactic and mathematical function of these networks to begin with, the depth of further knowledge which can be gleaned from the visualisation is significantly curtailed. 

Since the model takes an exhaustive approach to representing
every aspect of the network at hand, 
the simplified GOMS model below will 
focus solely on the goal of 
__grokking the behaviour of the first convolutional layer__ - the layer at which the input data is the least transformed and most recognisable.
